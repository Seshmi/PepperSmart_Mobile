Main Objective -

The main objective of this research is to develop a mobile app with a function that will aid bell pepper growers in the early detection of "powdery mildew" infection.

Main Research Questions -

What is the most effective method to detect powdery mildew infection in Bell Pepper plants in the early stage using a mobile application.

Individual Research Questions -

Are there visual symptoms of powdery mildew infection? ,
If not, how to capture them using this mobile application? ,
What image processing and object detection technologies can be used to accurately detect powdery mildew infection in Bell Pepper plants?

What is the potential of developing a technology for identifying the severity stage of powdery mildew in bell pepper plants and showing it on a polytunnel map?

What are the key factors and challenges in implementing a knowledge and content sharing platform for farmers, and how can these platforms effectively facilitate information exchange, collaboration, and learning among farmers?
